[1. The three states of awareness - Mandukya]
  Advaith Vedanta is basically a rainbow of multiple ideas taken up from other ancient traditions, to make the Vedantic life more practical, diverse and catering to the needs of the nature of human mind in a macro level.
  It teaches that there is one omnipresent Truth - the only Reality - The Brahman. Everything else is an illusion and projection of this same Brahman. Those are known as Maya. [“ब्रह्म सत्यं जगत मिथ्या”]

  As per Mandukya Upanishad following are the three primary states of consciousness that our Real self experiences -
  i. Waking state - <Vishwa>
  ii. Dream state - <Swapna>
  iii. Deep sleep state - <Pragnya>

  Our ego experiences each of the two above states in their own contexts. Outside their respective context and scope, the reality ceases to exist.

  There is a 4th state of our awareness known as <Turiyam> which overarches all these three states. It is a continuum that enables us to experience and be aware that we were sometimes in waking state, sometimes in dream state, and sometimes in deep sleep state. This witness consciousness is always there. It is - <changless "नित्य">. That consciousness is there alive sitting and watching us when we are deep asleep too! That is Brahman/Atman/God/Divine. This entire world is just a false apparition that shows up in the awareness of Brahman.

  This <Turiyam> is different from the <observer-observed> or <Prakriti-Purusha> concept of *SANKHYA* and *YOGA* philosophy. Rather in Advaith, Turiyam is the only real. Everything else is just a subjective experience of that Turiyam. There is no Prakriti as an object out there. Prakriti shows up as a manifestation in the awareness of Turiyam.

[2. The relationships between the various reflections of the SatChitAnand - Conscious witness - Drigdrishya Viveka DDV]
  We see ourselves as limited bodies. So the Advaith Vedanta frees us from this limitation.
  1. Widness consciousness is reflected in the mind as a <reflected consciousness>
  2. This reflected consciousness in identification with the ego, transmits that consciousness throughout the body.
  3. Body borrows its consciousness from the senses.
  4. Senses borrows its consciouness from the mind.
  5. Mind borrows its consciouness from reflected consciouness
  6. Reflected consciouness is the borrowed true Self witness consciouness within us.

  1. I - The Witness Consciouness is related to the body via Karma. Snapped by death.
  2. Relationship between the ego (I sense in the mind) and the Self - error.

  [The various states of mind DDV]
  1. The witness consciousness remains the same.
  2. The various degree of awareness - active to totally dull and then to deep sleep - are the various states of the mind. Based on the state of the mind the awareness vary. Duller the mind is, dimmer is the reflection of the real witness consciouness happening. So, Tamas arrives in.

[3. Quality of a Guru] 14/05/2020, 06:25:44
  Shrotriya - श्रोत्रिय - learned in one tradition.
  Brahmanishtha - ब्रह्मनिष्ठा - one pointed focus and dedication to Brahman. Life rotates around Brahman

[4. Svadharma]
  1. Varna Dharma - Kshatriya
  2. Varna Ashrama Dharma - Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyasa
  3. Vishesha Dharma - as per the current role - principal, president
  4. Sadharana Dharma - Universal dharma of everybody. Dharma of being human - generosity, truthfulness, kindness, compassion, love.

[5. The Subjectivitiy of Sakshi - Atman]
  The 3 states of awareness in life -
  1. Vishwa  - awake state
  2. Swapna  - dream state
  3. Pragnya - deep sleep

  There is a sense of sakshi - awareness - consciousness that cuts across all the three states. That is existence - Sat - Atman. That is the witness of even the I! The sense of I, borrows that experience and says, I had a deep sleep or I had a dream. But in doing so, the Vishwa I is just doing a proxy over the Swapna I or the Pragnya I. Actually the Atman / Self / Brahman all of these refer to that One - Sat - Existence that overarches these three states of I. That is Divine! And that Divine is One in all! It does not only overarchs all the states of a personal ego, but also the collective ego. That is Advaith!

[6. Looking at the glass]
  When you look at the mirror you want to look at your self, not on to the glass. When you see life and see life in that, you are seeing the glass. But when you see the 10,000 things in life and seeing the God, you are seeing yourself in the mirror!

[7. Tat sakshi tuave chethanam]
  When you get a thought, be aware of that witness of that thought. The roaring of the Ganges.
