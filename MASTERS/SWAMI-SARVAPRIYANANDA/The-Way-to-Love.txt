*THE MANY SPLENDORS OF LOVE*

1. `Bhikshu Paad Prasaarana Nyaya`
  God is a sweet maid who comes takes you over - Bhikshu Paad Prasaarana Nyaya! Your life gets covered by it.
  Heart is uplifted when deep uplifting emotions are there, heart melts for while. When heart melts for awhile, at that point whatever you *stamp* into it, that remains there forever! When heart melts, stamp the heart with the mantra of God. God will stay forever.

2. `Love of God is always expressed as seva to the beloved`
  Genuine love is always expressed in seva. More you do for Lord, more your love will increase. Connect all your daily work - eat, sleep etc to God. When you eat you feed the lord within. I am not eating. When you are listening to music, you are pouring that music to God. When you are walking, you are walking to the temple of Lord. When you are sleeping you are sleeping on the lap of Mother Goddess. Connect all your activities to God.

3. `The tears of viraha for God is more previous than any joy of life`
  Happiness is greater than all joys - Tripto Bhavati - Siddho Bhavati - Amrito Bhavati - By Love of God. Love is a many splendour thing

4. `Akshaya` - Love does not decay. Love is immortal. It never extinguished
    a. Taj is the tear drop on the face of Eernity - Tagore
    b. From the beginning of time till the end of time, there is such love between me and thee. How could such love ever be extinguished. Thou art of love. I am thy servant. Akshayshnu

5. `Duality after enlightenment - भक्ति अर्थम् कल्पितम द्वेतम् अद्वेतम् अपी सुन्दरम् `
  After enlightenment is achieved - you have realised that it is only the Lord that exist, then you adopt duality for the same of loving that Lord. That is more beautiful than non duality. Before duality puts you in sansara.
  Bhakti Artham Kalpitam Dwetam Advetam api sundaram

6. `नित्य नुतन:` Without love it is never mechanical, its always novel and beautiful and new.

7. `वक्रता` - Love always has a twist!
  Little teasing. Little abhimana. The little sweetness. There are lots of ups and downs.

8. `निर्भयता Fearlessness`

9. In the path of love the `distance is removed`. There is a peculiar intimacy with the God.

10. `Sneha` - colors all your life.

11. There is always a `desire to help`, to fix, to seva

12. `Grace or Kripa` - Kri - do something. Pa is to get something.


*PRACTICES*
1. `NAME` - Japa - Name is the extremely powerful way to reach God. Name and the Named are the same.
2. `EYES of the Lord`
3. `Bhibhuti` - Anything beautiful. Anything grand. Anything Awesome, relate to God, and be grateful to Him!
4. `God is Sat Chit Anand`.  Existence - Sat - all conscious experience - good or bad - uplifting and degrading - one golden thread remains unbroken - Consciousness - Chit - Lord, it is by your light everything else is visible. In every Joy - from eating a cookie, to loving someone - all joys - remember God. It is presence of God that makes that joy.
  I. EXISTENCES
  II. ALL EXPERIENCES - CONSCIOUSNESS
  III. ALL JOYS.
5. `Oneness in all Existences` ! - We see 10,000 waves. We do not see the one water running throuh all those. We see all the ornaments and get attracted to them. But we do not see the one gold running through all of them. We see all different personalities and get attached or replled by one or the other. But we do not see the one God running through all of them.

6. `Lord's Prasad` - `न्यास: Giving up to the LORD` - Everything is Prasada. Everything is divinized.  Offer every food, every thought, every action, every stuff, even breath and water to God, and then when God has accepted it, then take it! It becomes Prasad. Everything in life - not  just food, needs to be offered to the Lord and then accepted as Prasada. That is the sanctification of the food that has happened after being offered to God.
You got a new clothes, offer it to God and then accept it as Prasad. You buy a new gadget, offer it to God, and then accept it as Prasad. Offer all relationships, all words, all thoughts, all practices - eveything!
`This practice of offering everyhing to God is very important!`

7. `अन्य अाश्रय त्याग:` ' Give up all your support except God! Make God as your central and only ONE THING in life! - `SIMPLE MAN IN SERACH OF GOD!`
