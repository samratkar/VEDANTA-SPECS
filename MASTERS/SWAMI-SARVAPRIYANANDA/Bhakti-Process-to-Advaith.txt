In the dualistic path what will happen is that it will be `increasingly clear` that reality behind the objective world - God - `the Divine Mother` - Saguna Brahman. I worship and surrender to that! All encompassng. All loving. All Benevolent. All Powerful. Overtimet his will become a reality. Not just a question of belieeving in something. Just as you see this objective universe is real, you feel the God behind this objective world is also real. That God will become more and more real.
Objective world will reduce to a shadow and the Presene of God will be the greatest things in your life. That reality will become manifest. Your limitation of being a human being will become unimportant to you - to the point that you will feel not `I`,  but `THOU MY LORD`. - The Presnce of `THAT` is very clear to you now. it will be so amazing - so overpowering. That your little existinence will not matter any more. `Na hum. Na Hum. Tu Ho. Tu Ho`.

A mergence of the `limited individuality` to that `Infinite Reality` happens.
