I am a computer science engineeer. Worked on Honeywell Aerospace as technologist in C++ design and development of mission critical embedded systems for 9years. It was during that time when I started getting interested in the group dynamics of cross functional teams of developers, architects, system engineers, project management teams, subcontractors. The projects started becoming very facintating around the dynamics around the following -
1. Status
2. Diversity
  i. Demographics differences
  ii. gender differences
  iii. geographic differences
  iv. expertise and domain differences.
Engaged curious colleagues. I love this.
